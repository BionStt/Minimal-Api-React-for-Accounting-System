I can import the ReactJS App from other place and then use VS2022 to run the App. Also include debug.

Below is the steps I do on my side:

1, Put these two files under the root directory of the project:

reactproject1.esproj

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.VisualStudio.JavaScript.Sdk/0.5.26-alpha">
  <PropertyGroup Label="Globals">
    <ProjectGuid>a9857706-c039-4a3c-8997-3f5756ae92a3</ProjectGuid>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <StartupCommand>set BROWSER=none&amp;&amp;npm start</StartupCommand>
    <JavaScriptTestRoot>src\</JavaScriptTestRoot>
    <JavaScriptTestFramework>Jest</JavaScriptTestFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
reactproject1.esproj.user

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup />
</Project>
After that, your react app will be able to run in VS2022, but still unable to debug.

If you need debug, you need to add a folder named '.vscode' under the root directory. After that, create a file named 'launch.json', this file is the configuration file for debug react app:

launch.json

{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "localhost (Chrome)",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    {
      "type": "edge",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "localhost (Edge)",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
This is the structure of the react app on my side:
